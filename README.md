# 📍Understanding Node.js Basics : 
    it's neither a programming language nor a technology also not a framework and library, It is JavaScript runtime enviornment.

    👉We can't create backend from javaScript as JavaScript didn't have any functionalities like that.

    👉 Ryan Dahl thinks to create Backend with JavaScript so he is playing with the V8 engine of Google Chrome as it is Open Source. As V8 engine is made of C++ so he think to do it in JavaScript

    👉 Ryan Dahl create wrapper over the C++ code it means javaScript is wrapped over V8 engine code, It means We write the code in JavaScript and Wrapper receives it and create a Server with the help of C++.

    👉Node.js is javaScript runtime environment 


# 📍Node.js and npm -> 
    npm is place where people upload their own packages and others can use it as per their needs.

# 📍npm init -> 
    👉package.json (lekha jokha of the project)

    👉const fs = require('fs'); it means we have the power of 'fs' in our varibale fs

    👉fs.writeFile is used to create a new file and data into it

    👉fs.rename is used to rename the files

    👉fs.readFile is used to read a file

    👉fs.copyFile is used to copy files from one    folder to another. 

    👉fs.unlink is used to remove any files

# 📌Understanding HTTP Modules 

    👉 There are some rules and regulation on the Internet and are pre-installed in the software of your Operating System.

    👉 Windows, Linux, MacOs are helping the software who supports for the following of these rules and regulation.

    👉 HTTP is also a protocol or rule without it's rules you can't even send or receive on the internet. If i don't use HTTP protocol then you can say you can't use internet(there are also many reasons but you can say it is one of them).


    👉 const http = require('http'); this method is used to access the HTTP protocol or you can make your own server using it.
